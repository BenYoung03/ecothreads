# Ecothreads
Ecothreads is a web page created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a part of the Lakehead University Google Developer Student Club Hackathon which resulted in my team and I placing second out of 22 projects! I was the lead developer of the team and created this prototype as a part of the challenge and it was presented to the judges with resounding success.

# Problem Statement - Sustainable Exchange for Lakehead University 
Fast fashion is recognized as a major sustainability issue. The pesticides used to grow cotton end up in water systems, making 1kg of textile generate approximately 23 kg of GHGs, and consumers typically discard clothing twice as fast as they did 15 years ago. While the average Canadian spends approximately $200/month on clothing and accessories, food and housing insecurity is on the rise and many students are struggling to support their basic needs. Within the Lakehead community of students, faculty, and staff, there is an abundance of textile resources that could be donated and redistributed - clothing, shoes, outerwear, accessories, etc. How can we create an exchange system within the LU community that is simple to use, easy to maintain, accessible to all, and preserves dignity - all while supporting students and the environment

# Expectation
A practical scalable App/Website which can be used by the university to reduce the environment impact while achieving the goal. While helping students, faculty, and staff to donate and redistribute clothing, shoes, outerwear and accessories.

# Getting Started
To use the Ecothreads website, [click here!](https://benyoung03.github.io/ecothreads/)

The website allows you to sort by clothing item, add items to the clothing system and mock order items. The login button also brings you to a mock log in portal. To scale this project further, the login functionality could be linked to the Lakehead University portal itself, orders could be handled instead of being mock handled, and admins should only be able to add items to the system as Lakehead University members will bring there clothing to a central location on campus, and donate it and the admin of the system will input the item information and store the item in order to keep anonymity between the donor and the receiver!
